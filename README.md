# myshell

myShell (msh) is a custom shell written in C++ that serves as an alternative to existing command line interfaces like Bash and zsh. msh supports a whole range of commands like cd, history, exit, alias, ls, cat, grep. It also supports environment variable manipulation(declare), output redirection(>, >>), piping(|), command history(history), and command aliasing(alias).
